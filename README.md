### BATTLESHIPS

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum.

It focuses on practicing Test Driven Development with Jest, building apps with Webpack, styling with scss, multiple modules, object oriented programming, etc.

The game includes an algorithm that lets the computer player better guess where the human player's ships are, based on already hit locations.
